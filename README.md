# GEOG5990_Final_Project

The project explores the correlation between levels of deprivation and the availability of central heating in different Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in Leeds. With approximately 13% of households lacking central heating in 2021, financial deprivation is identified as a significant factor. Understanding this correlation is crucial for effectively allocating heating resources and determining affordable central heating infrastructure. Utilizing data from the 2011 UK Census, deprivation levels categorized into five levels are analyzed alongside central heating availability data. The study involves cleaning the dataset, calculating percentages, assessing correlations, and visualizing the relationship through scatter plots and choropleth maps. Data sources include the Infuse UK Data Service and the Open Geography Portal of the Office for National Statistics.

The objective of this project's code is to illustrate the correlation between deprivation levels and central heating availability across Leeds LSOAs using scatter plot and choropleth maps. Reproducing the analysis requires access to all datasets, conveniently available in the GitHub repository. Essential Python libraries like geopandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and contextily are employed for data manipulation, visualization, and mapping, necessitating their importation. Each line of code in the Jupyter notebook is well annotated to facilitate reproducibility. Additionally, the markdowns in the notebook provide detailed instructions on variable relationships, analysis, and visualization choices, further enhancing code reproducibility.
